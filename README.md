note :
1. there is no collison
2. it has a canvas size of 1440p, it is not dynamic so it may not fit in your monitor
3. it is not fully optimized
4. it uses newtonian gravity
5. i suggest you edit the code to change the resolution to fit to your monitor size
6. it is fully html and has js and css integrated in it so it is compact and fits in just 1 file 
7. i hope u understand the code as i deletd all the comments i use to understand the code to look smart and that i dont need to remember but actaually i am very dumb
8. i made this as a project to learn js a bit as i aminly use python. it is very hard to code without having libraries that easu your code.
9. i am very proud of the css and design
